	<p> Live video streaming is becoming an increasingly popular form of interaction in social media, with mobile devices being used for sharing of remote situation "on the go."
	    We are interested in how such forms of interaction can be applied to mobile telepresence, i.e., a quick and effortless way of "teleporting" users to a remote location, where they can share each others' viewpoints and collaborate. 
	    We developed an application that achieves such effect by taking advantage of spatial data inferred from mobile devices' onboard sensors and embeds realtime video streams into panoramic mixed reality displays. 
	    To validate our solution we conducted a preliminary study and observed a statistically significant decrease in cognitive workload as well as increase in spatial and situational awareness among users in comparison with a regular videoconferencing application. 
	    Believing in the novelty of our approach, we plan to extend our application with environment mapping and empathic interface functionality.

	<p> To say that the digital age has disrupted the media & entertainment industry would be an understatement. The business model based on the 30-second ad has become an exercise in savage reductionism: nobody leaves whole.
	    To understand what the future can hold for the incumbent media & entertainment space—a way forward—it is helpful to look at the technology companies that are usurping them by either design or chance.
	    What strengths do they enjoy? 
	    <b>Speed and Openness</b>
	    The presence of pure-play digital technology companies in this space collapses the rate of technological turnover from ten years to five years to less. The rate of change speeds in the consumer space, in particular. It’s now under a year.
	    The most successful firms in this space have embraced openness by embracing a platform strategy. By definition, people who pursue this strategy commit to developing a space—a marketplace—where participating benefits all parties.
	    Apple has created this space with iTunes. Twitter has done the same with its approach, as has Kickstarter. The fact that they attracted rich media content happened because the community saw sharing pictures and videos as yet another dimension to engagement.
	    Where does the incumbent media & entertainment firm start, then? Creating the equivalent of a Twitter or Kickstarter in house seems unlikely. In the near term, it is.
